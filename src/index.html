            <h3>Game Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Turbo Football: Champions is a game which allows you to bet on the
              outcome of virtual matches between 48 different European teams.
              The game runs a virtual tournament consisting of an initial league
              stage where each team will play 8 matches (4 at home and 4 away) ,
              with teams being awarded 3pts for a win and 1pt for a draw. After
              all the teams have played their 8 matches their position in the
              league is assessed. The top 8 teams will proceed automatically to
              the later Round of 16 stage. Teams in positions 9th through to
              24th are paired up based on league positions e.g 9th plays 24th,
              10th plays 23rd etc and each pairing play each other in a 2 legged
              play off round, with the winner on aggregate over the two leg
              proceeding to the Round of 16. Subsequent knockout rounds (round
              16, Quarter finals and Semi Finals) are also played over
              two-legged format until 2 teams remain to face each other in a
              winner takes all Final.
            </p>
            <h3>Match Betting Markets</h3>
            <p>
              The only match betting market available is the match outcome after
              90 mins (not including any extra time or penalties). This is often
              called the 1x2 market and possible outcomes are limited to Team A
              wins (team A scores more goals than team B), Team B wins (team B
              scores more goals than team A) or the match ends in a draw (team A
              scores same number of goals as team B).
            </p>
            <p>
              Each of the teams in the tournament are given a strength/rank
              indicating how good a team they are. When a match occurs the
              strengths of the two teams and whether there is home advantage or
              not is used to present appropriate odds. The outcome of the match
              is determined by a RNG event with weighting applied proportionally
              to the listed odds.
            </p>
            <h3>Bet Types</h3>
            <p>
              Players are allowed to bet on either singles – outcome of a single
              match, or accumulators bets on the outcome of a number of matches
              (selections) together. Each selection must be correct in order for
              the accumulator to win and the payout multiplier is the product of
              the odds for each selection. Thus, if even a single selection is
              incorrect the accumulator bet will lose , and no winnings will be
              returned.
            </p>
            <h3>Bet Boost</h3>
            <p>
              The game offers the ability for accumulators to randomly have
              their odds boosted by either 10,20,50 or 100%. The probability of
              an accumulator bet having a bet boost increases with the number of
              selections in the accumulator.
            </p>
            <h3>Placing a bet</h3>
            <p>
              The game will present you with the main area showing matches to be
              played that game round. A bet placement area at the bottom, a
              countdown to when the matches will be played in the top bar and
              below this either the current league table or the results of
              knockout stages, depending on the game week.
            </p>
            <p>
              The game will show the odds for team A win, Draw and Team B . to
              place a bet simply select your desired stake, then click the odds
              of the selection you wish to bet on. You can make selections on 1
              or many of the matches being played that game week, if you have
              made a selection from more than 1 match, you can then decide
              whether you wish to place single bets or an accumulator by
              clicking/touching the appropriate button. The bet area will show
              your total outlay and potential returns. To place the bet use the
              BET button before the countdown reaches 0.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once bet has been successfully placed your placed bet counter will
              increase by 1, and if your bet has been given a bet boost you will
              be notified of the boost amount.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the countdown reaches 0, the game will cycle to the results
              screen where match results will be shown and a summary of the
              amount stake and returned for that game week will be shown. The
              game will then cycle back to showing the matches for the next
              round.
            </p>
            <h3>Outright Betting</h3>
            <p>
              At the start of each new tournament there is an opportunity to bet
              on the Outright/Tournament winner, which is a bet that the team
              selected will win the tournament.
            </p>
